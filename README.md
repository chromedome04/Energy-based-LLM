# Energy-based-LLM

This project is an attempt to use an energy-based LLM (trained using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine) to generate reasonable, interpretable, sentences. We are trying to determine if a high dimensional, high complexity model is required to generate reasonable sentences, as is used in the mainstream.
